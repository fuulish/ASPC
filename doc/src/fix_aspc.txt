fix aspc command :h3
fix aspc/drude command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID aspc/style args flag1 flag2 ... flagN :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
style = {aspc/drude} :l
    {aspc/drude} args = N DAMP FCON
        N = chain length of predictor
        DAMP = damping factor for predictor, value smaller than zero chooses default
        FCON = harmonic force constant for Drude particles

zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended :l
keyword = {scf} or {neval}
    {scf} value = {yes} or {no}
    {neval} value = N
        N = # of corrector evaluations

[Examples:]

fix 1 DRUDES aspc/drude -1. 1000

[Description:]

Integrate the equations of motion of polarizable particles, described by Drude
oscillators.  The algorithm first estimates the induced dipoles using a
predictor of variable chain length. This estimate is then corrected by
application of the self-consistent field equation (usually once) on top of the
newly predicted induced dipoles.

The predictor is a linear extrapolation:

\begin{equation}
 \mu^p(t+h) = 2 \mu(t) - \my(t-h) + \sum_{j=1}^{k} A_j \{ \mu(t-[j+1]h) - 2\mu(t-jh) + \mu(t - [j-1]h) \}.
\end{equation}

The coefficients $A_j$ have been determined to ensure time-reversibility by
cancelling those terms that cause irreversibilty in the integration of the
equations of motion.

The actual implementation uses the simplified form of the predictor:

\begin{equation}
 \mu^{p}(t+h) = \sum_{j=0}^{k-1} B_{j+1} \mu (t-jh)
\end{equation}

where

\begin{equation}
 B_j = A_j - 2 A_{j-1} + A_{j-2}.
\end{equation}

NOTE: The "fix drude command"_fix_drude.html is required.

NOTE: The Drude particles must not have a vdW potential acting on them, i.e.,
coefficients in, e.g., "lj/cut/coul/long"_pair_lj.html should be set to zero.

NOTE: For aspc/drude the force constants of all Drude particles needs to be the
same and has to be specified explicitly, in the form $U = 0.5 * k * (x -
x_0)^2$, where $k$ is the force constant.
